# Custom CXX
A custom implementation of commonly used C++ standard library components, with a focus on performance, scalability, and clean code.
## Goals
- Implement vector-like ( Vector ) and list-like ( List) containers.
- Add Basic Features: dynamic resizing, iterators, and element access.
- Recreate algorithms like sorting ( sort ), searching ( binary_search ), and transformations ( map, reduce ).
- Implement a String class supporting dynamic memory management, concatenation, and slicing.
- Optimize memory usage and compare with std::string.
- Build a simple thread pool and synchronization primitives (like a custom Mutex).
- Develop a lightweight testing framework for validating library components.
- Use the library in a showcase application (e.g., a text editor with the String class, or a mini web server, TBD).

# CustomCXX

CustomCXX is a modern, lightweight, and educational C++ library built from scratch, inspired by the Standard Template Library (STL). The goal of this project is to deepen understanding of C++ fundamentals and showcase clean, efficient, and extensible code.

## Features
- Custom implementations of common STL components like `Vector`, `List`, and more.
- Self-contained algorithms (e.g., `sort`, `binary_search`).
- Lightweight and dependency-free design.
- Comprehensive unit tests and documentation.

## Why CustomCXX?
This project is designed as a learning tool for aspiring C++ developers. It demonstrates:
- Advanced use of templates and generic programming.
- Efficient memory management techniques.
- Modern C++ best practices (C++17+).

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
